i am experienced with ethereum and for sure, i am interested in "Ã­t`s" future.

also working on testnets, poa-based structures and virtualized solutions,
got also into the "docker world" in may 2019, 
being also active participant in the goerli-testnet.

willing to work on infrastructural planning and implementing solid, reliable structres
to enable evm-based contract engines.

experienced in training other people in "what i do"- as well,

whereas i deeply respect infura and other services providing rpc-endpoints for devs and users,
as well as i like and agree on the ideas of metamask, as well as https://mycrypto.com and others.

apart from that also i am also user of the ENS-system and willing to learn even more about that.

solved questions in over 100 situations with disaster character

feel free to request 
i only get paid in ETH or DAi
