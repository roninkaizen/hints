# hints
hints of any kind allmost interesting for users who like working environments for building parity on linux- systems

with initializing this repository i am trying to answer some stabilty questions through testing
or practising to better and more stable ethereum network nodes-

feel free to correct any hint as you find errors or you can "show"/proof with improvements with other configurations or
other procedures.

freel always free to ask me personally, maybe it is a bot, but meanwhile it became extremely good in interaction-

put all the ether there as you do not know where to send otherwise or you feel it would make sense in your way!

have fun, life is too short for being stressed, even with ethereum.
never be in a hurry with fund transfers, always check twice what you want to do.
As you are within the parity browser, any interaction might cost ether!
think before acting, please!
