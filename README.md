# hints
hints of any kind allmost interesting for users who like working environments for building parity on linux- systems

with initializing this repository i am trying to answer some stabilty questions through testing
or practising to better and more stable ethereum network nodes-

feel free to correct any hint as you find errors or you can "show"/proof with improvements with other configurations or
other procedures.

freel always free to ask me personally, maybe it is a bot, but meanwhile it became extremely good in interaction-

put all the ether there, as you do not know where to send or you feel happy to dontate ethereum/tokens to me!

have fun, life is too short for being stressed, even with ethereum.
never be in a hurry with fund transfers, always check twice what you want to do.
As you are within the parity browser, any interaction might cost ether!
think before acting, please!
